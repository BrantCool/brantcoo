         <p> <id="Nothing"/> I have nothing to really talk about, so I think I will just sort of speak my mind, mainly, about the current workload.</p>
       <p2> It will be a sort of social experiment I guess, where whenever I have a thought about thes current school stuff, I will come hear and write. It will be like a look into the world of an all honors student. </p2>

             <h6> I am getting headaches from this one particular class today.
              When I <strong> finally </strong> get organized, I just got bombshelled with another thing. I had my work organized, do reading, math, then project, but now I am doing this extra thing, when I could be doing that, getting free time. So far, apart from the first few days, I have not had a break. Constant work, constant dealines, constant tests. I have not had a day where I have had no work due, no tests to stress about, and no projects coming up. Technically, last friday was a free day, but i had a test and project to worry about, and wasted the day not doing anything. That is the bad part about things, for me, when I have a break, I don't take it as a break, I take it as procrastinating because of the stuff. I just want a break, also I have a headache.
